# Testimonial Box

Testimonial Box is a clean and responsive testimonial slider built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It automatically cycles through user testimonials with a synchronized progress indicator, providing a polished and distraction-free UI component.

This project focuses on **clean DOM manipulation**, **deployment stability**, and **lightweight frontend architecture** without using frameworks or external font libraries.
